Pushes to `master` branch require successful pass of tests.

Tests can be executed using `composer test`, *NOTE* [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and PHP 7 is required see README.
Or they are automatically executed on commits at [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/phramework/schema-data_template)
The test validate's the definition of JSON schema in `data_template/` directory.

New data template MUST follow the specification available at [specification/data_template.md](https://github.com/phramework/schema-data_template/blob/master/specification/data_template.md)
